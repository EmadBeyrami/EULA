- Created using AI technology provided by Apple or other third-party providers

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

### 4.1 Your Control

You have full control over your data:

- **Delete from device**: Uninstalling the App removes all local data
- **Delete from iCloud**: You can delete iCloud data through iOS Settings or the App
- **Export data**: You can export your data using the App's export features

### 4.2 Account Deletion

Since we do not create accounts or store data on our servers, there is no account to delete. Removing the App and clearing iCloud data completely removes all traces of your information.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Wournal is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through our App, please contact us so we can delete such information.

## 6. International Data Transfers

If you use iCloud Sync, your data may be stored in data centers located outside your country of residence, in accordance with Apple's iCloud terms. We do not independently transfer your data internationally.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:

- **Access**: View the data stored in the App
- **Correction**: Edit your data within the App
- **Deletion**: Remove your data from the App and iCloud
