   - Data goes to YOUR iCloud account
   - Subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

### Data Deletion

**To delete your data:**

1. **Local Data:** Delete the App from your device
2. **iCloud Data:** Use the "Delete iCloud Data" option in Settings > iCloud Sync, then delete the App

**We cannot delete your data because we don't have access to it.**

### Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data:
- There is no data to request
- There is no data to export (beyond what's already on your device)
- There is no data to delete from our servers (because we have no servers)

### International Users

All data processing happens on your device or in your iCloud account. Data does not leave your device except for optional iCloud sync, which uses Apple's infrastructure.

### Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
